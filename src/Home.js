              Having moved to Japan at the age of 20, I have worked in a number
              of industries. I began my journey in Japan as many do, as an
              English teach in a rural city. However, the whole time I was
              yearning to move to the big city and work in the videogame
              industry. After searching high and low, I ended up finding a
              position in Tokyo, working as a videogame translator. It was a
              dream come true to be wrapped in the heart of the gaming world.
              However, after several years of working in the videogame industry,
              I began to feel the itch for change, for a challenge. I had always
              loved computers, having built a few for myself and friends, and
              being the designated IT-guy in the family. In 2021, I decided to
              delve deeper into this interest in tech and enrolled in an
              intensive programming bootcamp known as Code Chrysalis. Not only
              had I never written a single line of code before, but my son had
              just been born a few months prior. I had hopes that this would set
              me on a new path in my career and life, but I didn't quite realize
              just how difficult, and rewarding, this choice would be.

              Code Chrysalis was a flurry of learning. I had never written a
              single line of code before, and here I was taking a course to
              learn full-stack programming. Every day we were studying new
              technologies, including data-structures, GraphQL, SQL databases,
              React, Node, containers, and a little sprinkle of Ruby for good
              measure.
